# The files uses for active flight/tests

## Design and use:
We use Fusion 360 for all 3D prints:
(https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)

In fusion we design using mostly the basic tools there, but we have been given course so we know and can improve. Our goal is to design more advanced 3D models later on for TVC (thrust vectoring) and such.

To print we use ultimaker Cura:
(https://ultimaker.com)

This allows us to have more freedom to have low infill when we need to save on weight, or hight innfill when we need robust (for the nose).


## File Examples:

### - Nose cone (the nose we used for first flight)

### - Tailfin

## Setup:

We mounted the tailfins as sees under. this is how we mounted them in all the flights with wings
