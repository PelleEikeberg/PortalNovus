# Flightcomputer v1
Mostly pictures for the flightcomputer

## The circuit drawing of the sensors and such that we need.

## Goal
The flightcomputer is a build on the previous version (version v0). This version has sensors and a SD card for logging the data. The goal was to have a card for igniting the parachute piston, and logging the data in such a way we can use the sensors and not a timer in the next version.

## How the flight-computer progressed

### - made a mock-up that had only the sensors and SD connected to show how they worked

### - made a more advanced version (still on solder-less) to test lights and the accelerometer.

### - made the soldered-on version. this had only the basics:

### - made simple version that had light indicators and the sensors to test the logging:

### - logged to test the data:

The height plotted from simple elevator trip. The last datapoint is not correct, mostly because we have to stop the SD logging by turning the data off. this means the last point is almost always bad.

### - made mock-up with battery onto the tubing that was about to go into the rocket

### - minor touches, added sound module and gripper for the parachute wires
