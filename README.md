## Purpose of the repository
This repository is for showing the work completed or nearly finished. We will add files and work that requires almost no fixes, and can be used as is. The .stl files are the ones we have used in active flights. The arduino code and pictures of circuits, are the circuits we have used in launches and/or tests.

This is not a repository that is meant as a guide, but rather a "museum" that we can use to compare our newer projects with the previous ones

<!-- ### Videos
some flight videos and videos of the projects underway -->

### flightcomputer
The different versions of the flightcomputer. the v1 is the current version, and has datalogger and lights and sound.

### Fusion_and_STL_files (3D .stl files, and Fusion files)
Different categories for the files, some files are for non-TVC and other for TVC

<!-- ### Code (arduino code, both for flight computer and launchpad)
Codes for flight computer and launchpad. some codes change drastically depending on the hardware -->
